# GameEngine
*2D game engine created during the covid confinement from 2019 to 2021.*

Sooo...
This 2D game engine is a project that I maintained for 2 years. The goal was to learn as many programming concepts as possible with this project. What I succeeded.
Don't try to launch the game engine as it is, the purpose of this GitHub repos is above all to show you how I coded.
This project is part of the long list of "programs that work on the developer's pc but not elsewhere" haha.
Compatibility is simply planned for windows (only win10 has been tested).

Nevertheless, this project is very complete with the support of several functionalities, all coded by me:
- 2D map in color with adaptation to the screen and to the desired size (see Content/engine.ini).
- Support for music and soundscapes.
- Player center on the map with full animation.
- Adaptive game map.
- Functional and complete GUI.
- Environment interacting with the player.
- NPCs and enemies with player or object tracking.
- Quest system.
- Adaptive FPS to be able to unlock images and support performance drops.
- OpenGL support.
- Keyboard, mouse and gamepad events supported.
- And 12 billion other things...
